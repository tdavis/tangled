There are numerous outstanding issues with this implementation.

- 	Persistent connections do not actually check to ensure that Keep-Alive is
	sent back by the server meaning that web servers which don't actually
	support it will cause errors from connections which believe they are still
	open even though they're not.
	
-	Pipelining flat out doesn't work because of "too much recursion" exception
	when sending many requests back-to-back.
	
-	The timeout handling could probably be improved.

-	Redirect handling is done by juggling `Deferred`s which may be excessively
	ugly.
	
-	Error handling could probably be done much more intelligently when it comes
	to `Agent`.
	
More or less, this is a proof of concept that I just so happen to be using
fairly successfully in a production environment, so long as persistence is
avoided. I fully plan to improve on and fix the bugs in it once time allows.
